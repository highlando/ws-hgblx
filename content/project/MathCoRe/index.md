The research training group *MathCoRe* at that OVGU provides a both challenging and supporting environment for a small community of graduate students to pursue a PhD in a field that relates to mathematical complexity reduction.

Currently, I'm supervising two PhD students in this project and there is always a chance to set up another PhD project -- please use the above link to see the scope of *MathCoRe* and just apply.
