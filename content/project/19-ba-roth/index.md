*Thermographic Particle Image Velocimetry* (TPIV) is an optical technique to measure the temperature and velocity of fluid flows. In the ideal situation, scalar measurements are taking by collecting the light emissions from a single point at the crossing of a laser beam and the optical axis of the camera. In practice, however, through the interaction of spontaneous emissions and light scattering, additional light emissions reach the camera on other paths. The objective of this project was to theoretically quantify the contribution of unwanted light.
