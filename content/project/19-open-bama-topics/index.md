All projects can be fitted to the needs in terms of complexity, quantity and theory to programming ratio. 

If you are interested, just drop by...

## Computational fluid dynamics and control

 * Optimal distributed control of nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations via differential-algebraic matrix Riccati equations

 * Boundary control of cylindric flow using particular Couette-solutions

As these projects base on numerical analysis and system and control theory, they are very suitable for students of mathematics. Basic knowledge of numerical mathematics and a programming language is mandatory. Knowledge of control theory and fluid dynamics will be useful.

## Control of Dynamical Systems

 * Advanced control of a double or triple pendulum
 * Low-budget realization of a double pendulum 
 
These projects have a hardware component. They are particularly suited for control or electrical engineers, but also for students of mathematics that have a favor for engineering applications. 

In cooperation with the Magdeburg company [*Hasomed*](https://www.hasomed.de).

## Modelling and Simulation

 * Spurious lights in laser measurements

With Jun.-Prof. Benoit Fond (OvGU Magdeburg, Institute of Fluid Dynamics and Thermodynamics)
