abstract: The Navier--Stokes equations are commonly used to model and to simulate
  flow phenomena. We introduce the basic equations and discuss the standard methods
  for the spatial and temporal discretization. We analyse the semi-discrete equations
  -- a semi-explicit nonlinear DAE -- in terms of the strangeness index and quantify
  the numerical difficulties in the fully discrete schemes, that are induced by the
  strangeness of the system. By analyzing the Kronecker index of the difference-algebraic
  equations, that represent commonly and successfully used time stepping schemes for
  the Navier--Stokes equations, we show that those time-integration schemes factually
  remove the strangeness. The theoretical considerations are backed and illustrated
  by numerical examples.
