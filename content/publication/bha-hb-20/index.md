abstract: "In this paper, we present a method to compute the optimal trajectories of a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem corresponding to a single input, index-1 constant coefficient DAE system. Further, we also show that using a suitably designed proportional-derivative (PD) state-feedback controller one can force the trajectories of the corresponding DAE system to its optimal trajectories. Unlike the results present in the literature, the results in this paper are applicable for any arbitrary initial condition of the system."
