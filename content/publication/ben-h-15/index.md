abstract: "Recent theoretical and simulation results have shown that Riccati based feedback can stabilize flows at moderate Reynolds numbers. We extend this established control setup by the method of LQG-balanced truncation. In view of practical implementation, we introduce a controller that bases only on outputs rather than on the full state of the system. Also, we provide a very low dimensional observer so that the control actuation can be computed in an online fashion."
