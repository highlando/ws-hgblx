abstract: "The construction of reduced order models for flow control via a direct discretization of the input/output behavior of the system is discussed. The spatially discretized equations are linearized such that an explicit formula for the corresponding input/output map can be used to generate a matrix representation of the input/output map. Estimates for the approximation error are derived and the applicability is illustrated via a numerical example for the control of a driven cavity flow."
