abstract: The construction of reduced order models for flow control via a direct discretization
  of the input/output behavior of the system is discussed. The spatially discretized
  equations are linearized such that an explicit formula for the corresponding input/output
  map can be used to generate a matrix representation of the input/output map. Estimates
  for the approximation error are derived and the applicability is illustrated via
  a numerical example for the control of a driven cavity flow.
