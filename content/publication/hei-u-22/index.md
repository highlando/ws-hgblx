abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a popular data-driven framework to extract
  linear dynamics from complex high-dimensional systems. In this work, we study the
  system identification properties of DMD. We first show that DMD is invariant under
  linear transformations in the image of the data matrix. If, in addition, the data
  are constructed from a linear time-invariant system, then we prove that DMD can
  recover the original dynamics under mild conditions. If the linear dynamics are
  discretized with the Runge&ndash;Kutta method, then we further classify the error
  of the DMD approximation and detail that for one-stage Runge&ndash;Kutta methods;
  even the continuous dynamics can be recovered with DMD. A numerical example illustrates
  the theoretical findings.
