abstract: 'Output-based controllers are known to be fragile with respect to model
  uncertainties. The standard H∞-control theory provides a general
  approach to robust controller design based on the solution of the $$mathcal H_ınfty
  $$-Riccati equations. In view of stabilizing incompressible flows in simulations,
  two major challenges have to be addressed: the high-dimensional nature of the spatially
  discretized model and the differential-algebraic structure that comes with the incompressibility
  constraint. This work demonstrates the synthesis of low-dimensional robust controllers
  with guaranteed robustness margins for the stabilization of incompressible flow
  problems. The performance and the robustness of the reduced-order controller with
  respect to linearization and model reduction errors are investigated and illustrated
  in numerical examples.'
