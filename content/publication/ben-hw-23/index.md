abstract: Algebraic Riccati equations with indefinite quadratic terms play an important
  role in applications related to robust controller design. While there are many established
  approaches to solve these in case of small-scale dense coefficients, there is no
  approach available to compute solutions in the large-scale sparse setting. In this
  paper, we develop an iterative method to compute low-rank approximations of stabilizing
  solutions of large-scale sparse continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations with
  indefinite quadratic terms. We test the developed approach for dense examples in
  comparison to other established matrix equation solvers, and investigate the applicability
  and performance in large-scale sparse examples.
