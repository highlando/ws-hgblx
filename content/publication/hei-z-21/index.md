abstract: The concept of turnpike connects the solution of long but finite time horizon
  optimal control problems with steady state optimal controls. A key ingredient of
  the analysis of the turnpike is the linear quadratic regulator problem and the convergence
  of the solution of the associated differential Riccati equation as the terminal
  time approaches infinity. This convergence has been investigated in linear systems
  theory in the 1980s. We extend classical system theoretic results for the investigation
  of turnpike properties of standard state space systems and descriptor systems. We
  present conditions for turnpike in the nondetectable case and for impulse controllable
  descriptor systems. For the latter, in line with the theory for standard linear
  systems, we establish existence and convergence of solutions to a generalized differential
  Riccati equation.
