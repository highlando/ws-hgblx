abstract: We consider the stabilization of incompressible fluid flow using linearized
  and spatially discretized models. In order to potentially work in applications,
  the designed controller must stabilize the discrete model with a robustness margin
  that covers linearization, discretization, and modeling errors. We expand on previous
  results that a linearization error in the infinite-dimensional model amounts to
  a coprime factor uncertainty and show that H∞-robust controllers can compensate
  this in the discrete approximation. In numerical experiments, we quantify the robustness
  margins and show that the H∞-robust controller, unlike the LQG-controller, is capable
  of stabilizing nonlinear incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with an inexact
  linearization.
