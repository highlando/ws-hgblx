abstract: "We consider the stabilization of incompressible fluid flow using linearized and spatially discretized models. In order to potentially work in applications, the designed controller must stabilize the discrete model with a robustness margin that covers linearization, discretization, and modeling errors. We expand on previous results that a linearization error in the infinite-dimensional model amounts to a coprime factor uncertainty and show that H∞-robust controllers can compensate this in the discrete approximation. In numerical experiments, we quantify the robustness margins and show that the H∞-robust controller, unlike the LQG-controller, is capable of stabilizing nonlinear incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with an inexact linearization."
