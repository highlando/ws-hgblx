 abstract = {The stabilization of laminar flows on the base of linearizations and feedback
controllers has been the subject of many recent theoretical and computational studies. However,
the applicability of the standard approaches is limited due to the inherent fragility of observer
based controllers with respect to arbitrary small changes in the system. We show that a slight
variation in the Reynolds number of a flow setup amounts to a coprime factor perturbation in
the associated linear transfer function. Based on these findings, we argue that known concepts
from robust control can be exploited to come up with an output feedback law that can stabilize
the cylinder wake over the transition period from a stable to a stabilized regime.},
