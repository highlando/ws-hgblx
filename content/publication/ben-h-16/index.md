abstract: The stabilization of laminar flows on the base of linearizations and feedback
  controllers has been the subject of many recent theoretical and computational studies.
  However, the applicability of the standard approaches is limited due to the inherent
  fragility of observer based controllers with respect to arbitrary small changes
  in the system. We show that a slight variation in the Reynolds number of a flow
  setup amounts to a coprime factor perturbation in the associated linear transfer
  function. Based on these findings, we argue that known concepts from robust control
  can be exploited to come up with an output feedback law that can stabilize the cylinder
  wake over the transition period from a stable to a stabilized regime.
