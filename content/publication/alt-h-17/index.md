abstract: We consider mechanical systems where the dynamics are partially constrained
  to prescribed trajectories. An example for such a system is a building crane with
  a load and the requirement that the load moves on a certain path.  Enforcing this
  condition directly in form of a servo constraint leads to differential- algebraic
  equations (DAEs) of arbitrarily high index. Typically, the model equations are of
  index 5, which already poses high regularity conditions. If we relax the servo constraints
  and consider the system from an optimal control point of view, the strong regularity
  conditions vanish, and the solution can be obtained by standard techniques.  By
  means of the well-known n-car example and an overhead crane, the theoretical and
  expected numerical difficulties of the direct DAE and the alternative modeling approach
  are illustrated. We show how the formulation of the problem in an optimal control
  context works and address the solvability of the optimal control system. We discuss
  that the problematic DAE behavior is still inherent in the optimal control system
  and show how its evidences depend on the regularization parameters of the optimization.
