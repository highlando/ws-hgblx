abstract: 'The control of nonlinear large-scale dynamical models such as the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is a challenging task. The computational challenges in the controller design come from both the possibly large state space and the nonlinear dynamics. A general purpose approach certainly will resort to numerical linear algebra techniques which can handle large system sizes or to model order reduction. In this work we propose a two-folded model reduction approach tailored to nonlinear controller design for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and similar PDE models that come with quadratic nonlinearities. Firstly, we approximate the nonlinear model within in the class of LPV systems with a very low dimension in the parametrization. Secondly, we reduce the system size to a moderate number of states. This way, standard robust LPV theory for nonlinear controller design becomes feasible. We illustrate the procedure and its potentials by numerical simulations.'
