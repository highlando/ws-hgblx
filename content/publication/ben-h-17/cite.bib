 abstract = {Riccati-based feedback is commonly applied for the stabilization of flows in theory and in simulations. Nonetheless, there are few attempts to show the convergence of numerically computed feedback gains to the feedback defined by the actual model. In this work, we investigate how standard finite-dimensional formulations approximate the system dynamics and provide sufficient conditions for the convergence of the numerical approximations. The sufficient conditions are partially established for the model problem of the cylinder wake.},
