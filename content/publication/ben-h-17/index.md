abstract: Riccati-based feedback is commonly applied for the stabilization of flows
  in theory and in simulations. Nonetheless, there are few attempts to show the convergence
  of numerically computed feedback gains to the feedback defined by the actual model.
  In this work, we investigate how standard finite-dimensional formulations approximate
  the system dynamics and provide sufficient conditions for the convergence of the
  numerical approximations. The sufficient conditions are partially established for
  the model problem of the cylinder wake.
