abstract: We propose a fluid-rigid body interaction benchmark problem, consisting
  of a solid spherical obstacle in a Newtonian fluid, whose centre of mass is fixed
  but is free to rotate. A number of different problems are defined for both two and
  three spatial dimensions. The geometry is chosen specifically, such that the fluid-solid
  partition does not change over time and classical fluid solvers are able to solve
  the fluid-structure interaction problem. We summarise the different approaches used
  to handle the fluid-solid coupling and numerical methods used to solve the arising
  problems. The results obtained by the described methods are presented and we give
  reference intervals for the relevant quantities of interest.
