abstract: We present a framework for the direct discretization of the input/output
  map of dynamical systems governed by linear partial differential equations with
  distributed inputs and outputs. The approximation consists of two steps. First,
  the input and output signals are discretized in space and time, resulting in finite
  dimensional spaces for the input and output signals. These are then used to approximate
  the dynamics of the system. The approximation errors in both steps are balanced
  and a matrix representation of an approximate input/output map is constructed which
  can be further reduced using singular value decompositions. We present the discretization
  framework, corresponding error estimates, and the SVD-based system reduction method.
  The theoretical results are illustrated with some applications in the optimal control
  of partial differential equations.
