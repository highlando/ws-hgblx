abstract: This paper presents a new frequency-selective filter based frequency separated
  feedback control strategy for disturbance attenuation over multiple frequency ranges.
  The measured output/state of the plant is firstly separeted/divided into auxiliary
  frequency-limited outputs/state by introducing a group of pre-specified frequency-selective
  filters. Furthermore, a group of frequency-selective controllers is designed to
  render the frequency-selective component of the closed-loop system. With the aid
  of generalized KYP lemma, the design of control gains can be recasted into solutions
  to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, the effectiveness of the
  proposed method is illustrated via numerical examples.
