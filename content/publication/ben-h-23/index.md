abstract: The quantification of multivariate uncertainties in partial differential
  equations can easily exceed any computing capacity unless proper measures are taken
  to reduce the complexity of the model. In this work, we propose a multidimensional
  Galerkin Proper Orthogonal Decomposition that optimally reduces each dimension of
  a tensorized product space. We provide the analytical framework and results that
  define and quantify the low-dimensional approximation. We illustrate its application
  for uncertainty modeling with Polynomial Chaos Expansions and show its efficiency
  in a numerical example.
