abstract: We discuss the direct discretization of the input/output map of linear time-invariant
  systems with distributed inputs and outputs. At first, the input and output signals
  are discretized in space and time, resulting in a matrix representation of an approximated
  input/output map. Then the system dynamics is approximated, in order to calculate
  the matrix representation numerically. The discretization framework, corresponding
  error estimates, a SVD-based system reduction method and a numerical application
  in optimal flow control are presented.
