abstract: "We discuss the direct discretization of the input/output map of linear time-invariant systems with distributed inputs and outputs. At first, the input and output signals are discretized in space and time, resulting in a matrix representation of an approximated input/output map. Then the system dynamics is approximated, in order to calculate the matrix representation numerically. The discretization framework, corresponding error estimates, a SVD-based system reduction method and a numerical application in optimal flow control are presented."
