abstract: "We provide spatial discretizations of nonlinear incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with inputs and outputs in the form of matrices ready to use in any numerical linear algebra package. We discuss the assembling of the system operators and the realization of boundary conditions and inputs and outputs. We describe the two benchmark problems driven cavity and cylinder wake and provide the corresponding data. The use of the data is illustrated by numerous example setups. The test cases are provided as plain Python or Octave/MATLAB script files for immediate replication."
