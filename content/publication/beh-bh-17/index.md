abstract: We provide spatial discretizations of nonlinear incompressible Navier-Stokes
  equations with inputs and outputs in the form of matrices ready to use in any numerical
  linear algebra package. We discuss the assembling of the system operators and the
  realization of boundary conditions and inputs and outputs. We describe the two benchmark
  problems driven cavity and cylinder wake and provide the corresponding data. The
  use of the data is illustrated by numerous example setups. The test cases are provided
  as plain Python or Octave/MATLAB script files for immediate replication.
