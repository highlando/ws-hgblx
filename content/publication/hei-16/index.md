abstract: We investigate existence and structure of solutions to quadratic control
  problems with semiexplicit differential-algebraic constraints as they appear in
  the modeling of flows. We introduce a decoupled representation of the state and
  the formal adjoint equations to identify the conditions for the existence of solutions.
  We derive a differential-algebraic Riccati equation formulated in the original coefficients
  for the efficient numerical computation of the optimal solution.
