abstract: 'Polytopic autoencoders provide low-dimensional
parametrizations of states in a polytope. For nonlinear PDEs,
this is readily applied to low-dimensional linear parameter-
varying (LPV) approximations as they have been exploited for
efficient nonlinear controller design via series expansions of the
solution to the state-dependent Riccati equation. In this work,
we develop a polytopic autoencoder for control applications
and show how it outperforms standard linear approaches in
view of LPV approximations of nonlinear systems and how the
particular architecture enables higher order series expansions
at little extra computational effort. We illustrate the properties
and potentials of this approach to computational nonlinear
controller design for large-scale systems with a thorough
numerical study.'
