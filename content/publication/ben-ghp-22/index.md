abstract: Reduced-order modeling has a long tradition in computational fluid dynamics.
  The ever-increasing significance of data for the synthesis of low-order models is
  well reflected in the recent successes of data-driven approaches such as Dynamic
  Mode Decomposition and Operator Inference. With this work, we suggest a new approach
  to learning structured low-order models for incompressible flow from data that can
  be used for engineering studies such as control, optimization, and simulation. To
  that end, we utilize the intrinsic structure of the Navier-Stokes equations for
  incompressible flows and show that learning dynamics of the velocity and pressure
  can be decoupled, thus leading to an efficient operator inference approach for learning
  the underlying dynamics of incompressible flows. Furthermore, we show the operator
  inference performance in learning low-order models using two benchmark problems
  and compare with an intrusive method, namely proper orthogonal decomposition, and
  other data-driven approaches.
