abstract: A general framework for the regularization of constrained PDEs, also called
  operator differential-algebraic equations (operator DAEs), is presented. The given
  procedure works for semi-explicit and semi-linear operator DAEs of first order including
  the Navier-Stokes and other flow equations. The proposed reformulation is consistent,
  i.e., the solution of the PDE remains untouched. Its main advantage is that it regularizes
  the operator DAE in the sense thata semi-discretization in space leads to a DAE
  of lower index. Furthermore, a stability analysisis presented for the linear case,
  which shows that the regularization provides benefits also for the application of
  the Rothe method. For this, the influence of perturbations is analyzed for the different
  formulations. The results are verified by means of a numerical example with an adaptive
  space discretization.
