abstract: The optimization of a controlled process in a simulation without access
  to the model itself is a common scenario and very relevant to many chemical engineering
  applications. A general approach is to apply a black-box optimization algorithm
  to a parameterized control scheme. The success then depends on the quality of the
  parametrization that should be low-dimensional though rich enough to express the
  salient features. This work proposes using solution snapshots to extract dominant
  modes of the temporal dynamics of a process and use them for low-dimensional parametrizations
  of control functions. The approach is called proper orthogonal decomposition in
  time (time-POD). We provide theoretical reasoning and illustrate the performance
  for the optimal control of a methanation reactor.
