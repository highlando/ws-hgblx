# Mini Symposium

Data based methods have been in use for model order reduction (MOR) or control systems design (CSD) for several decades. Classical system identification approaches and established model reduction techniques like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition all follow the idea of using data to fit or enhance a model. With the ever increasing availability of both data and computing resources as well as with the recent trends towards the inclusion of machine learning (ML) in scientific computing, data-driven methods have gained new interest and application fields also in MOR and CSD. In contrast to the more classical approaches, these are often entirely data-driven, and can thus easily applied to measurements as well. 

In this mini symposium, we bring together experts from the fields of MOR, CSD, and ML who combine classical methods with recent developments in data-driven modelling to discuss theoretical foundations, the current state of research, and future applications.
