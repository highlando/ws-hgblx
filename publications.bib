  abstract = {We discuss a Krylov subspace projection method for model order reduction of a special class of quadratic-bilinear descriptor systems. The goal is to extend the two-sided moment-matching method for quadratic-bilinear ODEs to descriptor systems in an efficient and reliable way. Recent results have shown that the direct application of interpolation based model reduction techniques to linear descriptor systems, without any modifications, may lead to poor reduced-order systems. Therefore, for the analysis, we transform the quadratic-bilinear descriptor system into an equivalent quadratic-bilinear ODE system for which the moment-matching is performed. In view of implementation, we provide algorithms that identify the required Krylov subspaces without explicitly computing the projectors used in the analysis. The benefits of our approach are illustrated for the quadratic-bilinear descriptor system of semi-discretized Navier-Stokes equations.},

frequency-selective controllers is designed to render the frequency-selective component of the closed-loop system. With the aid
of generalized KYP lemma, the design of control gains can be recasted into solutions to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).
Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated via numerical examples.},

In order to potentially work in applications, the designed controller must stabilize the discrete model with a robustness margin that covers linearization, discretization, and modeling errors. We expand on previous results that a linearization error in the infinite-dimensional model amounts to a coprime factor uncertainty and show that H∞-robust controllers can compensate this in the discrete approximation. In numerical experiments, we quantify the robustness margins and show that the H∞-robust controller, unlike the LQG-controller, is capable of stabilizing nonlinear incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with an inexact linearization.},

We introduce the basic equations and discuss the standard methods for the spatial and temporal discretization. We analyse the semi-discrete equations -- a semi-explicit nonlinear DAE -- in terms of the strangeness index and quantify the numerical difficulties in the fully discrete schemes, that are induced by the strangeness of the system. By analyzing the Kronecker index of the difference-algebraic equations, that represent commonly and successfully used time stepping schemes for the Navier--Stokes equations, we show that those time-integration schemes factually remove the strangeness. The theoretical considerations are backed and illustrated by numerical examples.},

  abstract = {We consider mechanical systems where the dynamics are partially constrained to
prescribed trajectories. An example for such a system is a building crane with a load and the
requirement that the load moves on a certain path.

Enforcing this condition directly in form of a servo constraint leads to differential-
algebraic equations (DAEs) of arbitrarily high index. Typically, the model equations are of
index 5, which already poses high regularity conditions. If we relax the servo constraints and
consider the system from an optimal control point of view, the strong regularity conditions
vanish, and the solution can be obtained by standard techniques.

By means of the well-known n-car example and an overhead crane, the theoretical and
expected numerical difficulties of the direct DAE and the alternative modeling approach are
illustrated. We show how the formulation of the problem in an optimal control context works
and address the solvability of the optimal control system. We discuss that the problematic
DAE behavior is still inherent in the optimal control system and show how its evidences
depend on the regularization parameters of the optimization.},

The proposed reformulation is consistent, i.e., the solution of the PDE remains untouched. Its main advantage is that it regularizes the operator DAE in the sense thata semi-discretization in space leads to a DAE of lower index. Furthermore, a stability analysisis presented for the linear case, which shows that the regularization provides benefits also for the application of the Rothe method. For this, the influence of perturbations is analyzed for the different formulations. The results are verified by means of a numerical example with an adaptive space discretization.},

controllers has been the subject of many recent theoretical and computational studies. However,
the applicability of the standard approaches is limited due to the inherent fragility of observer
based controllers with respect to arbitrary small changes in the system. We show that a slight
variation in the Reynolds number of a flow setup amounts to a coprime factor perturbation in
the associated linear transfer function. Based on these findings, we argue that known concepts
from robust control can be exploited to come up with an output feedback law that can stabilize
the cylinder wake over the transition period from a stable to a stabilized regime.},

This paper contributes a new approach based on the theory of differential-algebraic equations. Motivated by the index reduction technique of minimal extension, a remodellingof the flow equations is proposed. It is shown how this reformulation can be realized for standard finiteelementsviaa decomposition of the discrete spaces and that it ensures stable and accurate approxi-mations. The presented decomposition preserves sparsity and does not call on variable transformationswhich might change the meaning of the variables. Since the method is eventually an index reduction,high index effects leading to instabilities are eliminated.},

The ever-increasing significance of data for the synthesis of low-order models is well reflected in the recent successes of data-driven approaches such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Operator Inference. With this work, we suggest a new approach to learning structured low-order models for incompressible flow from data that can be used for engineering studies such as control, optimization, and simulation. To that end, we utilize the intrinsic structure of the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flows and show that learning dynamics of the velocity and pressure can be decoupled, thus leading to an efficient operator inference approach for learning the underlying dynamics of incompressible flows. Furthermore, we show the operator inference performance in learning low-order models using two benchmark problems and compare with an intrusive method, namely proper orthogonal decomposition, and other data-driven approaches.},

  abstract = {Algebraic Riccati equations with indefinite quadratic terms play an important role in applications related to robust controller design. While there are many established approaches to solve these in case of small-scale dense coefficients, there is no approach available to compute solutions in the large-scale sparse setting. In this paper, we develop an iterative method to compute low-rank approximations of stabilizing solutions of large-scale sparse continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations with indefinite quadratic terms. We test the developed approach for dense examples in comparison to other established matrix equation solvers, and investigate the applicability and performance in large-scale sparse examples.},

  abstract = {The design of controllers for general nonlinear PDE models is a difficult task because of the high dimensionality of the partially discretized equations. It has been observed that the embedding of nonlinear systems into the class of linear parameter varying systems (LPV) gives way to apply linear theory and methods from numerical linear algebra for controller design. The feasibility of the LPV approach hinges on the dimension of the inherent parametrization. In this work we propose and evaluate combinations of convolutional neural networks and clustering algorithms for very low-dimensional parametrizations of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.},

  abstract = {The concept of turnpike connects the solution of long but finite time horizon optimal control problems with steady state optimal controls. A key ingredient of the analysis of the turnpike is the linear quadratic regulator problem and the convergence of the solution of the associated differential Riccati equation as the terminal time approaches infinity. This convergence has been investigated in linear systems theory in the 1980s. We extend classical system theoretic results for the investigation of turnpike properties of standard state space systems and descriptor systems. We present conditions for turnpike in the nondetectable case and for impulse controllable descriptor systems. For the latter, in line with the theory for standard linear systems, we establish existence and convergence of solutions to a generalized differential Riccati equation.},

  abstract = {The optimization of a controlled process in a simulation without access to the model itself is a common scenario and very relevant to many chemical engineering applications. A general approach is to apply a black-box optimization algorithm to a parameterized control scheme. The success then depends on the quality of the parametrization that should be low-dimensional though rich enough to express the salient features. This work proposes using solution snapshots to extract dominant modes of the temporal dynamics of a process and use them for low-dimensional parametrizations of control functions. The approach is called proper orthogonal decomposition in time (time-POD). We provide theoretical reasoning and illustrate the performance for the optimal control of a methanation reactor.},

  abstract      = {With the advancement of neural networks, there has been a notable increase, both in terms of quantity and variety, in research publications concerning the application of autoencoders to reduced-order models. We propose a polytopic autoencoder architecture that includes a lightweight nonlinear encoder, a convex combination decoder, and a smooth clustering network. Supported by several proofs, the model architecture ensures that all reconstructed states lie within a polytope, accompanied by a metric indicating the quality of the constructed polytopes, referred to as polytope error. Additionally, it offers a minimal number of convex coordinates for polytopic linear-parameter varying systems while achieving acceptable reconstruction errors compared to proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). To validate our proposed model, we conduct simulations involving two flow scenarios with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. Numerical results demonstrate the guaranteed properties of the model, low reconstruction errors compared to POD, and the improvement in error using a clustering network.},
